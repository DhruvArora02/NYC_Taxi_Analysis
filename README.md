# NYC_Taxi_Analysis
This project demonstrates how to use Databricks and PySpark to process, analyze, and visualize taxi trip data. Using a dataset of NYC taxi rides, I built an end-to-end data pipeline that loads raw CSV data, cleans and transforms it, performs statistical analysis, and generates visual insights.
