# üöñ NYC Taxi Data Analysis with Databricks & PySpark  

This project analyzes NYC taxi trip data using **Databricks**, **PySpark**, and **Spark SQL** to showcase skills in big data processing, data engineering, and analytics. The notebook loads raw CSV data, cleans and transforms it, performs statistical analysis, and creates visualizations to uncover insights about taxi fares, trip distances, and popular pickup/dropoff locations.

## üöÄ Features  
- **Data Ingestion:** Load CSV data into Spark DataFrames.  
- **Data Cleaning:** Convert timestamps, handle missing values, and format numeric fields.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Extract trip hour, day-of-week, and trip duration.  
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Aggregations with PySpark DataFrame API.  
  - SQL-style analysis with Spark SQL.  
- **Visualizations:**  
  - Trip counts by hour of day.  
  - Average fare by pickup location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Databricks Community Edition**  
- **Apache Spark / PySpark**  
- **Spark SQL**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**

## üìä Insights from the Analysis  
- Peak taxi demand occurs in the evening hours.  
- Central Park and JFK Airport have the highest average fares.  
- Most trips are under 10 miles and have 1‚Äì3 passengers.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nyc-taxi-databricks.git
cd nyc-taxi-databricks
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Open in Databricks
- Sign up for Databricks Community Edition.

- Create a new Notebook and set the default language to Python.

- Upload the NYC_Taxi_Analysis.ipynb file.

- Upload the CSV dataset to your Databricks workspace /FileStore/.

- Update the file path in the notebook if needed.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run Locally (Optional)
Install dependencies:
```
pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib
```
Open Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```
Load and run NYC_Taxi_Analysis.ipynb.

## üìå Possible Improvements
- Integrate with real NYC TLC trip data API.

- Use Delta Lake for optimized storage.

- Build an interactive dashboard with Plotly or Power BI.
